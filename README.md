Ask your PDF ðŸ’¬ : 
A Streamlit application that extracts text from a PDF file and answers questions based on the extracted text.



Description : 
This Python script utilizes several libraries and modules to create a Streamlit application for processing PDF files. It extracts text from the uploaded PDF, splits it into chunks, and builds a knowledge base for question answering. Users can ask questions about the PDF content, and the application provides answers based on the extracted text.



Features : 
Upload PDF files to extract text from them.
Perform text extraction and chunking for efficient question answering.
Utilize OpenAI embeddings for text processing.
Use a question-answering chain for answering user questions.
Display answers in the Streamlit app interface.


Installation : 
Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/CodeThat/Langchain-Chat-PDF.git



Change to the project directory :
cd your-repository



Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) : 
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage : 
Make sure you have activated the virtual environment (if created).

Run the script: python script.py

Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501).

Upload a PDF file using the file uploader in the Streamlit app.

Enter your question about the PDF content in the provided text input.

View the answer displayed in the app interface.
